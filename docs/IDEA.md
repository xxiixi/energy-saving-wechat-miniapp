# Initial idea

#### 1. Auto Running ACs

Automatically turn off and on the air conditioner according to the classroom and use time of the offline course.

According to the indoor temperature:

1. Set the air conditioner temperature and air volume.
2. Decide whether the AC should turned on( it is already the suitable temperature)
3. Whether it needs to be turned on in advance(eg. if it is too hot, turn it on ten minutes earlier)

#### 2. Motion absence

Through the sensor or camera to determine whether the current classroom has people come in to study, to determine whether the lights and air conditioning have been turned off after the classroom is empty, if not, all off.

#### 3. Automatically turn off the lights when no one is in the classroom.

The camera collects whether someone is in the room, sends a signal to the sensor, and the sensor turns off the light.Just focus on turn off the light,because if have someone enter to study hall,they will turn on them.
